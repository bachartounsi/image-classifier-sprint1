This project implements and deploys an image classification API capable of predicting object categories from uploaded images.
It integrates with the Hugging Face Inference API to leverage pre-trained deep learning models for accurate and scalable predictions.

The goal of this sprint was to connect a backend service (built in Python/Spring Boot) to a cloud-based model hosted on Hugging Face, allowing easy testing and evaluation of inference requests through REST endpoints.

Key Features:

🧩 Integration with Hugging Face API for image classification.

⚙️ RESTful API endpoints for single and batch image prediction.

🧠 Uses pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub for robust performance.

🧪 Tested locally and containerized for consistent deployment across environments.

📊 Logs and structured responses for easy integration with front-end or other services.
